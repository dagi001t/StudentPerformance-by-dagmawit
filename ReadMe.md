                              Questions Answerd By The Project 
                        

1. Question: What is the distribution of scores in math, reading, and writing among students?
   - The answer can be found by examining the box plot generated using Seaborn. It provides insights into the central tendency and spread of scores in each subject.

2. Question: How are average scores across subjects for students?**
   - The answer lies in the bar plot that illustrates the average scores across all students in math, reading, and writing. It gives a quick overview of the students' performance in each subject.

3. Question: Are there any outliers in the scores, and how are they distributed?
   - The z-score method is used to identify and handle outliers in the scores. The resulting distribution can be visualized using a box plot, shedding light on the presence and distribution of outliers in the dataset.

   

                                   Summary of Main Findings and Key Insights:

In this exploration of the student performance dataset, several noteworthy insights have emerged, shedding light on various aspects of students' academic performance. 

1. Performance Distribution Across Subjects:
   - The box plot analysis revealed that the majority of students performed well in reading and writing, with median scores higher than the median score in math. Math scores exhibited a wider spread, indicating greater variability among students.

2. Effect of Test Preparation on Scores:
   - A compelling observation was the positive impact of test preparation on students' scores. Those who completed a test preparation course tended to achieve higher scores in all subjects compared to their counterparts who did not undertake such preparation.

3. Parental Level of Education Influence:
   - Students with parents holding a master's degree consistently demonstrated higher average scores across all subjects. This suggests a potential correlation between parental education levels and student academic success.

4. Impact of Lunch on Scores:
   - Students who had a standard lunch exhibited higher scores on average compared to those with a free/reduced lunch. This trend suggests a potential link between a balanced diet and academic performance.

5. Outlier Detection and Handling:
   - Through the application of z-scores, we identified and handled outliers in the dataset, ensuring a more robust analysis by mitigating the impact of extreme values on our conclusions.

6. Overall Trends in Student Performance:
   - The bar plot depicting the average scores across subjects showcased a consistent pattern, with reading and writing scores surpassing math scores on average. This overarching trend provides a valuable insight into the relative strengths of students across subjects.
